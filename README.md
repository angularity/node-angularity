An opinionated node.js build system for ECMAScript 6 AngularJS projects

Angularity is a philosophy of development.

Our focus is maintaining uniformity of development across groups of developers with varying experience levels.

Our contributors hold a collective vision of best-practice AngularJS development and have condensed this into a set of tools and resources known as Angularity.
